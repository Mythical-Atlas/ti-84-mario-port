# ti-84-mario-port
A port of the classic Super Mario Bros. for the NES to the TI-84+ CE graphing calculator

Just as a note, this is an incredibly early version, and is in no way representative of the final product.

Most of my time working on this has been spent figuring out the hardware and its many, many quirks. Even though there is some documentation for the library, the actual programming is very hard to debug.

At the moment, it runs much slower than it should, and there isn't much in terms of gameplay, but progress is being made.
